# World Model

How knowledge, identity, and templates are organized across tenants and public
catalogs.

## TL;DR

- Public knowledge (HMRC, Barclays, Apple Inc, the £, tax years, …) lives in
  **public_catalog orgs** (`organization.visibility = 'public'`). Real-world
  entities, vocabularies, and templates are entities/types in those orgs.
- Each user gets a **tenant org** on signup (`visibility = 'private'`). Their
  `$member` entity, personal facts, filings, and message history live there.
- One graph: `entities` + `entity_relationships` + `entity_identities` are the
  universal primitives. Orgs are trust slices through that graph.
- Cross-org references flow **one direction only**: tenant → public_catalog.
  Public rows never reference tenant rows.
- Vocabulary (`entity_types`) is referenced by `id`, not by slug, so an entity
  in tenant org A can carry a type defined in public-catalog org B by FK
  alone — no per-row org_id column needed.
- App-level org-scoped queries plus a write-side guard on cross-org
  relationship inserts are sufficient given the one-directional rule. No
  Postgres RLS required.

## Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `organization` (with `visibility`) | Trust boundary |
| `entities` (typed rows, scoped to one org) | Anything: `$member`, a company, a tax filing, an agent template, a review |
| `entity_types` + `entity_relationship_types` | Vocabulary as **data** — new types are INSERTs, not migrations |
| `entity_relationships` (typed edges) | Semantic facts, references, forks, reviews |
| `entity_identities` ((namespace, identifier) → entity) | Technical lookup keys (`auth_user_id`, `email`, `wa_jid`, `uk_utr`, …) |

## Org topology

- **`tenant`** — user's private space (`visibility=private`). Personal data,
  installed agents, filings, message history.
- **`public_catalog`** — curated public knowledge (`visibility=public`).
  Companies, gov bodies, currencies, tax years, allowance definitions, agent
  templates, skills, reviews.

No third org kind. Templates are entities of type `agent_template` *inside* a
public_catalog org, distinguished by entity type, not by a separate org kind.

## Cross-org references

- Direction: tenant → public_catalog only.
- Reads never mix scopes — queries hit either the user's org
  (membership-scoped) or public orgs (`visibility=public` filter), never both
  in the same query. Removes the "every read site must remember `OR
  visibility=public`" risk.
- Write-side guard: when inserting an `entity_relationship`, validate that
  the target's org is either the same as the source or has
  `visibility='public'`. The relationship's organization_id always matches
  the source.
- Lookup of `entity_types` widens at write time via a **schema search path**:
  the agent declares which public catalogs it operates over, and the runtime
  walks [user's tenant org, then each declared catalog] when resolving a
  slug → `entity_type_id`. The resolved id is materialized on the entity row,
  so reads never need the search path.

## Identity

- One `$member` entity per (org, user). Auto-created on signup for the user's
  tenant org; lazy-created on first meaningful interaction in any other org
  they join.
- `entity_identities` holds technical IDs against `$member`: `auth_user_id`,
  `email`, plus connector-side IDs like `wa_jid`, `phone`, `uk_utr`.
- Service agents (e.g. a public org's admin agent) carry their own
  identities under a `service_agent` namespace and can be invited into
  private orgs the same way human users are.

`entity_identities` (technical lookup) and `entity_relationships` (semantic
facts) are separate tables. Don't conflate.

## Templates

A template is an entity of type `agent_template` in a public_catalog org:

- Carries: system prompt, model config, tool list, skill manifest, version,
  bot phone, descriptive metadata.
- Declares which public catalogs it uses via `uses_catalog` relationships
  (e.g. `uses_catalog` → `public-uk-tax`, `uses_catalog` → `public-uk-finance`).
- Authorship, forks, reviews, ratings: ordinary `entity_relationships`
  (`authored_by`, `forked_from`, `reviews`, `rated`).

Installation is a small INSERT into `agents` with `template_entity_id`
pointing at the template entity. No schema cloning — the agent reads
vocabulary from the catalogs declared in `uses_catalog`. Vocabulary updates
propagate automatically; catalog versioning is explicit at the type level
(e.g. `tax_filing@2024-25` and `tax_filing@2025-26` are separate
`entity_types` rows).

## Contribution to public knowledge

1. User has data in their tenant org they think the public catalog should
   know about.
2. User notifies the public org's admin agent via the existing chat path.
3. Admin agent requests read access; user invites it into their tenant org
   as a `viewer` (or `collaborator` if it should stamp a "synced as
   `<public_id>`" reference back).
4. Admin's agent reads, decides, writes the canonical entity into the public
   org.
5. User revokes membership when done.

Reuses existing org membership, role, audit, and revocation primitives. No
draft tables, no contributor role, no moderation queue. Trade-off: invitation
grants whole-org read; users wanting narrower control put contribution-bound
entities in a sharing sub-org.

## Use case: tax return

`public-uk-tax` (public_catalog) holds: HMRC, the £, tax years, SA forms
(SA100, SA102, SA105, SA108), allowance/relief definitions, filing deadlines.

`public-uk-finance` (public_catalog) holds: major banks, large PAYE-using
employers, the FCA, Companies House.

User's tenant org holds:

- `$member` with identities `auth_user_id`, `email`, `uk_utr`, `uk_ni`.
- One `tax_filing` entity per year. Relationships: `for_tax_year` → public
  tax year, `filed_with` → HMRC, `taxpayer` → `$member`,
  `includes_form` → form-instance entities.
- `income` entities with `source` → bank/employer in `public-uk-finance`.
- `expense` and `allowance_claim` entities pointing at public allowance
  definitions.

Filing time is a graph walk from `$member` → `taxpayer` → filing →
income/expense relationships, resolving sources via cross-org references.

## Use case: agent community

`public-templates` (public_catalog) holds one entity per published template
(`agent_template`), with `forked_from`, `next_version`, `authored_by`
relationships.

`public-community` (public_catalog, separate org for policy reasons) holds
`review` entities, ratings, tags. Splitting reflects different admin policies
(templates are author-editable; reviews are write-once-by-author) without
inventing new permission machinery.

## Long-term invariants

1. **Vocabulary as data** — adding entity types or relationship types is an
   INSERT, not a migration.
2. **`entity_types.id` is the type identity, slug is display** — never key
   data on the slug column.
3. **One graph, many orgs** — orgs are trust slices through one universal
   graph.
4. **Cross-org references are unidirectional** (tenant → public).
5. **`entity_identities` (technical) ≠ `entity_relationships` (semantic)** —
   keep them separate.

## Deferred (with rationale)

| Deferred | Why later |
| --- | --- |
| Postgres RLS | Not required given one-directional refs + scope-local reads; app-level enforcement is already in place. Add as defense-in-depth when there's an independent reason. |
| Claims (verified `works_at`, `owns_profile_of`, etc., with status machine, evidence refs, expiry, dispute primitives, permissions table) | Not needed for tax return or initial community. Real complexity — bring in when someone needs to claim ownership of a canonical entity. |
| Aliases / merges / tombstones for canonical entities | Needed at meaningful catalog scale. Premature before the first rename hurts. |
| Federation (cross-instance entity references) | No multi-instance need yet. |
| Fine-grained per-entity sharing | Whole-org invite is coarser but explicit. Sub-orgs are the escape hatch when needed. |
