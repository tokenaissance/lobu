title: Owletto CLI Reference
description: What the owletto CLI does, how it authenticates, how it installs Owletto starter skills, and how to use it to run Owletto tools directly.
---

The `owletto` CLI starts local Owletto runtimes, installs bundled Owletto starter skills, configures agent clients, and runs Owletto tools directly.

- Hosted: [app.lobu.ai](https://app.lobu.ai)

## Install And Run

```bash
# Run without installing
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory <command>

# Or install globally
npm install -g owletto
owletto <command>
```

The published package name is `owletto`.

## Core Commands

### `owletto start`

Starts a local Owletto runtime.

```bash
# `lobu memory start` was retired — `lobu run` is the only boot path
# `lobu memory start` was retired — `lobu run` is the only boot path
```

Default behavior:

- listens on `http://localhost:8787`
- uses embedded Postgres (`PGlite`) by default
- stores local data in `~/.owletto/data/` for packaged installs
- uses `./data/` when running from an `owletto` repo checkout

If `DATABASE_URL` is set, the CLI starts the server against external Postgres instead.

### `owletto skills`

Installs bundled Owletto starter skills into a local `skills/` directory.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory skills list
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory skills add owletto
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory skills add owletto-openclaw
```

Use:

- `owletto` for generic Owletto memory and tool workflows
- `owletto-openclaw` for OpenClaw-specific memory plugin setup

### `owletto init`

Configures local agent clients to use an Owletto MCP endpoint.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory init
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory init --url http://localhost:8787/mcp
```

Detects supported clients and auto-configures them when possible. Falls back to manual steps when needed.

## Authentication

### `owletto login`

Authenticates the CLI against an Owletto MCP server using OAuth.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory login https://lobu.ai/mcp
```

By default, the CLI opens a browser and completes an authorization-code flow with a local callback server.

Useful flags:

- `--device` uses device-code login for headless environments or browserless agents
- `--noOpen` prints the login URL instead of opening a browser
- `--scope` overrides the requested OAuth scopes

Example for a headless box:

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory login https://lobu.ai/mcp --device
```

### `owletto token`

Prints a usable access token from the saved session.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory token
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory token --raw
```

This is mainly useful for integrations or plugin setups that need a token command.

### `owletto health`

Checks that the saved session is valid and that the CLI can reach the MCP endpoint.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory health
```

## Organization Selection

Owletto sessions are organization-aware. After login, set the default org if needed:

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory org current
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory org set my-org
```

You can also override organization and server selection per command:

- `--org <slug>`
- `--url <mcp-url>`
- `OWLETTO_ORG`
- `OWLETTO_URL`

## Run MCP Tools Directly

### `owletto run`

Lists tools when called without arguments, or executes a tool when given a tool name and JSON params.

```bash
# List available tools
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory run

# Search knowledge
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory run search_knowledge '{"query":"Acme"}'

# Save new knowledge
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory run save_knowledge '{"content":"Prefers weekly summaries","semantic_type":"preference","metadata":{}}'

# Discover SDK methods (namespaces, signatures, examples)
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory run search '{"query":"watchers.create"}'

# Run a TypeScript script over the typed client SDK
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory run execute '{"script":"export default async (ctx, client) => client.entities.list({ entity_type: \"company\", limit: 5 })"}'
```

This is the most direct way to inspect or test Owletto behavior outside an agent runtime.

### Which MCP tools are available?

The exact tool list depends on the endpoint and your session scope. Run `owletto run` with no arguments to see what is available.

**Core memory:** `search_knowledge`, `save_knowledge`

**SDK surface:** `search` (method discovery), `execute` (run TS over the typed `ClientSDK` — replaces the previous `manage_*` MCP tools; reach handlers via `client.<namespace>.<method>(...)` from inside the script)

**Read-only SQL:** `query_sql` (admin/owner only)

**Organization:** `list_organizations`, `switch_organization` (exposed on both unscoped and scoped endpoints)

## Other Useful Commands

### `owletto doctor`

Checks local prerequisites such as Node, Docker, and current server reachability.

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory doctor
```

### `owletto browser-auth`

Captures browser-based auth or cookie state for connectors that rely on a real browser session.

This is mainly for connector setup, not day-to-day memory usage.

### `owletto configure`

Writes OpenClaw plugin config for `@lobu/owletto-openclaw` using an `owletto token` command.

## Typical Install Flow

For most users, the shortest path is:

```bash
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory skills add owletto
npx @lobu/cli@latest memory init
```

That gives the agent both:

- the **Owletto skill** so it knows how to use Owletto well
- the **MCP configuration** so it can actually connect to Owletto

## Repo-Local Development

When working inside the `owletto` repository itself, you can run the TypeScript entrypoint directly:

```bash
bun run packages/cli/bin/lobu.js memory start
bun run packages/cli/bin/lobu.js memory skills list
bun run packages/cli/bin/lobu.js memory init
bun run packages/cli/bin/lobu.js memory run search_knowledge '{"query":"spotify"}'
```

## How This Fits With Lobu

Use the Lobu CLI to scaffold and run Lobu projects. Use the `owletto` CLI to install the Owletto skill, configure clients, and operate Owletto itself.
