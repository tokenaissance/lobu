description: How Owletto compares to Mem0, Supermemory, and Letta on public memory benchmarks, and how to reproduce the numbers.
---

Owletto, the memory system bundled with Lobu, is benchmarked against external memory systems (Mem0, Supermemory, Letta, Zep) on public datasets. This page summarises the headline numbers and points at the reproducible harness in the Owletto repo.

## Headline results

Same answerer (`glm-5.1` via z.ai), same top-K, same questions, three trials per public configuration.

### LongMemEval (oracle-50)

Single-session knowledge retention.

| System | Overall | Answer | Retrieval | Latency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Owletto** | **87.1%** | **78.0%** | **100.0%** | 237ms |
| Supermemory | 69.1% | 56.0% | 96.6% | 702ms |
| Mem0 | 65.7% | 54.0% | 85.3% | 753ms |

### LoCoMo-50

Multi-session conversational memory (each scenario is ~19 sessions of 18+ turns, then a question grounded in the dialogue).

| System | Overall | Answer | Retrieval | Latency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Owletto** | **57.8%** | **38.0%** | **79.5%** | **121ms** |
| Mem0 | 41.5% | 28.0% | 66.9% | 606ms |
| Supermemory | 23.2% | 14.0% | 36.5% | 532ms |

## Methodology guardrails

The harness applies the following fairness constraints:

- **Per-scenario isolation** — every scenario runs in a fresh system state. Providers do not search across earlier scenarios from the same run.
- **Multi-trial public runs** — public full-QA configs default to three trials so reports show run-to-run variability.
- **Uniform top-K** — every adapter asks for exactly the configured `topK`. No silent overfetch.
- **Per-system answerer token totals** — leaderboards include answerer-side prompt and completion tokens so LLM cost is visible alongside accuracy.
- **Parallel system execution** — compare configs run systems in parallel (`Promise.allSettled`); one provider's failure does not abort the others.
- **Async ingest is waited out** — for providers that index asynchronously (Zep's `/graph-batch`), the adapter polls until the server reports the ingest processed.
- **Raw metrics first** — treat answer accuracy, retrieval recall, and citation quality as the primary comparison. The reported "overall" number is a secondary house score.

### Latency caveat

Latency is **retrieval-only latency**, not end-to-end wall clock. It is not fully apples-to-apples when one system is local/in-process and another is a hosted API. Owletto's retrieval path is a multi-step plan (query expansion, entity search, content search, linked-context fetches) — that orchestration is what gets it to 100% retrieval recall on LongMemEval but also costs round trips. Mem0 and Supermemory adapters issue a single provider search per question.

## Reproducing the results

The full harness lives in the [Owletto repo](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto) under [`benchmarks/memory/`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/tree/main/benchmarks/memory). The TypeScript runner is at `src/benchmarks/memory/`. External systems are integrated as long-lived Python adapter subprocesses framed over JSONL-on-stdin, which avoids per-op fork/exec cost.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Docker
- `ZAI_API_KEY` (z.ai, used as the answerer model `glm-5.1`)
- API keys for any external systems you want to include: `MEM0_API_KEY`, `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY`, `LETTA_API_KEY`, `ZEP_API_KEY`

### LongMemEval oracle-50, all systems

```bash
ZAI_API_KEY=... MEM0_API_KEY=... SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=... LETTA_API_KEY=... \
  pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.longmemeval.oracle.50.compare.all.zai.json
```

### LoCoMo-50, three-way (Owletto vs Mem0 vs Supermemory)

```bash
ZAI_API_KEY=... MEM0_API_KEY=... SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=... \
  pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.locomo.50.compare.top-memory.zai.json
```

### Owletto-only, no external API keys

```bash
# Retrieval-only (no answerer)
pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.longmemeval.oracle.50.json

# Full QA with z.ai answerer
ZAI_API_KEY=... pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.longmemeval.oracle.50.zai.json
ZAI_API_KEY=... pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.locomo.50.zai.json
```

### Smaller LoCoMo slices

```bash
pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.locomo.5.local.json
pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.locomo.10.compare.top-memory.zai.json
pnpm benchmark:memory --config benchmarks/memory/config.locomo.30.local.json
```

A complete table of available configs is documented in [`benchmarks/memory/README.md`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/README.md#available-configs).

## GitHub Actions

The Memory Benchmark workflow runs the same harness in CI and uploads JSON + Markdown artifacts.

- Workflow: [`benchmark-memory.yml`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmark-memory.yml)
- Trigger: [Actions → Memory Benchmark → Run workflow](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/actions/workflows/benchmark-memory.yml)

Inputs include `dataset` (`longmemeval-oracle` or `locomo`), `limit`, `trials`, `model` (answerer model id), and `providers` (comma-separated adapter list).

## Adapters

| System | Adapter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mem0 | [`adapters/mem0_adapter.py`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/adapters/mem0_adapter.py) | `MEM0_API_KEY` |
| Supermemory | [`adapters/supermemory_adapter.py`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/adapters/supermemory_adapter.py) | `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY` |
| Letta | [`adapters/letta_adapter.py`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/adapters/letta_adapter.py) | `LETTA_API_KEY` |
| Zep | [`adapters/zep_adapter.py`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/adapters/zep_adapter.py) | `ZEP_API_KEY` (Cloud) or `ZEP_BASE_URL` (self-hosted) |

To add a new system, write a Python adapter that defines `reset` / `setup` / `ingest` / `retrieve` action handlers. The shared protocol module is at [`adapters/_bench_protocol.py`](https://github.com/lobu-ai/owletto/blob/main/benchmarks/memory/adapters/_bench_protocol.py).

## Why Owletto wins on retention

Owletto blends three signals for recall:

1. Entity name matching
2. Full-text search
3. Semantic vector search

Plus structured retrieval — Owletto stores knowledge in entity types backed by JSON Schema, with first-class relationships and superseding writes. That is why it reaches 100% retrieval on LongMemEval where vector-only systems plateau in the 80–90% range.
