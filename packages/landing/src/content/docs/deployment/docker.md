Docker mode is the easiest way to run Lobu on a single machine.

## How It Works

1. `docker compose` starts gateway + Redis.
2. Gateway creates per-session worker containers on demand.
3. Each worker gets an isolated workspace directory (for example `./workspaces/{threadId}/`).
4. Worker network access goes through the gateway proxy (`HTTP_PROXY=http://gateway:8118`).

## Isolation Model

Lobu's Docker deployment uses two Docker networks:

- Public network for gateway ingress
- Internal network for worker-to-gateway traffic

Workers are attached to the internal network with no direct external route. External HTTP traffic is controlled by the gateway proxy and domain policy (`WORKER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` / `WORKER_DISALLOWED_DOMAINS`).

## When to Use Docker Mode

Use Docker mode when:

- You are getting started quickly
- You run a single-node production deployment
- You want simple operations without Kubernetes

## Operational Notes

- Start stack: `lobu run -d` or `docker compose up -d`
- Restart after `.env` changes
- Session persistence is provided by mounted workspace directories
