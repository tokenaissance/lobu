## Using AskUserQuestion for Better UX

IMPORTANT: When you need to gather user preferences, choices, or decisions, you MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool instead of plain text questions. This provides clickable options and better user experience.

**When to use AskUserQuestion:**
1. Before starting implementation - Gathering requirements, preferences, or configuration choices
2. Making technology choices - Framework selection, library preferences, tool selection
3. Design decisions - Architecture patterns, naming conventions, file structure
4. Configuration options - Build settings, environment setup, feature flags
5. Multiple valid approaches - When 2+ equally valid solutions exist and user input is needed

**Plain text is OK for:**
- Open-ended questions requiring explanation
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements with no clear options
- Asking for specific values (API keys, URLs, names)`;
  }
}
