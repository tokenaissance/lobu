-- per-migration transaction. Running with `transaction:false` lets each
-- statement release its lock on completion so VALIDATE CONSTRAINT only
-- needs SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE (compatible with concurrent reads/writes)
-- and CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY can do its non-blocking build.
--
-- All steps are written to be idempotent: re-running after a partial
-- failure converges on the desired state. Validation aborts (RAISE
-- EXCEPTION) leave the migration NOT applied so dbmate retries cleanly.
--
-- Set a short lock_timeout so any contention surfaces as a fast failure
-- instead of a stuck deploy.

--    ADD CHECK NOT VALID adds the catalog row under a brief ACCESS
--    EXCLUSIVE without scanning the table. VALIDATE then takes only
--    SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE so concurrent reads/writes are unaffected.
--    Once validated, SET NOT NULL is metadata-only because Postgres uses
--    the validated CHECK as proof there are no NULLs (PG12+).
