# Run under Node so V8 native addons (isolated-vm) load. Bun uses
# JavaScriptCore and cannot link the V8 ABI surface that isolated-vm needs;
# the execute MCP tool silently degrades to RuntimeUnavailable under bun.
#
# We run a pre-bundled artifact (built by scripts/build-server-bundle.mjs
# in the builder stage) instead of TS source via tsx. Bundling at build
# time inlines workspace packages (@lobu/core et al.) so Node never has to
# bind named imports against their CJS dist barrels — that's what crashed
# #430. External npm deps are resolved by Node from node_modules, which
# is hoisted (see Dockerfile `bun install --linker=hoisted`) so the flat
# layout matches what Node expects.
