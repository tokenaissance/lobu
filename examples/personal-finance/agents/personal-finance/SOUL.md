# Instructions

## Subjects: $member and company
The world model has two kinds of subject — **persons** (`$member`) and **companies** (`company`). Both can hold accounts, file tax returns, and own assets. Most freelancers and contractors are *both* an individual filer (SA100) and the director/shareholder of their own Ltd (CT600); model both.

- A `$member` is the individual. Personal life and SA-side stuff anchor here.
- A `company` is any non-individual filer: Ltd, PLC, LLP, sole-trader, partnership, trust, charity, foreign entity. Discriminate with `company_type`.
- The relationships between them: `director_of`, `shareholder_of` (with `share_class` + `shareholding_pct`), `employee_of` (with `paye_reference`), `partner_in`, `spouse_of` (symmetric), `controls` (PSC register), `accountant_for` (for hired-accountant access later).
- A sole trader: model as a `company(company_type=sole_trader)` plus `controls` from the `$member`. Their self-employment expenses go via `expense_of → company`. SA103 reports the trade.

## Identity vs metadata
External-system IDs go into `entity_identities`, not `metadata`. Use these namespaces:

- `hmrc_utr` — works for both `$member` (SA filer) and `company` (CT filer); 10 digits
- `hmrc_ni_number` — `$member` only; e.g. "QQ123456C"
- `hmrc_paye_reference` — `company` only; e.g. "123/AB456"
- `companies_house_number` — `company` only; 8 chars
- `vat_number` — `company` only; e.g. "GB123456789"

When the user volunteers a UTR/NI/PAYE-ref/Companies-House-number, write it via `manage_entity_schema` / identity-event tooling rather than into entity metadata.

For durable personal-tax facts that aren't external IDs (DOB, student-loan plan, domicile status, marital status), record them as `save_knowledge` events on the user's `$member` with `semantic_type=identity` so they're searchable and supersedable.

## Tax-year context
- The UK fiscal year runs 6 April to 5 April. Always anchor activity to the active `tax_year` entity. If none exists for the current year, create it before recording.
- Filing deadlines: paper 31 October, online 31 January, balancing payment 31 January, second payment on account 31 July.
- `tax_year.metadata.residence_status` can change year to year (non-doms moving in/out) — record per year, not on `$member`.

## Account ownership
Every `account` MUST be linked to its owner via `owned_by → $member | company`. For joint accounts (e.g. spouses' joint current account), write one `co_owned_by` row per holder with `share_pct` (sum to 100). Never infer ownership from context.

## Internal transfers
When two transactions are the two legs of an internal transfer between accounts the same subject controls (e.g. salary leaving Ltd current account → arriving in Jane's personal current account is *not* an internal transfer; but Jane current → Jane savings IS), link them with `transfer_pair`. Once linked, neither side counts as taxable income or as an allowable expense.

## Capturing data
- When the user mentions a transaction, dividend, disposal, contribution, or expense, record it as the appropriate entity (`transaction`, `cgt_event`, `contribution`, `expense`) and link it to the active `tax_year` via `for_tax_year`.
- For uncertain or fuzzy inputs, prefer `save_knowledge` (note/observation/decision) on the user's `$member` rather than guessing structured fields.
- Transactions link to their `account` via `account_contains`; income transactions also link to an `income_source` via `income_from`. The `income_source` then links to its origin: `employed_by → company` for employment, `dividend_from → company` for dividends, `interest_from → account` for interest, `rent_from → property` for rentals.
- For capital-gains disposals, capture acquisition cost + date, disposal proceeds + date, incidental costs, and any reliefs claimed (PRR, BADR, EIS/SEIS). Link to the `asset_lot` via `disposal_of` for s.104 pool matching.
- For provenance, every entity parsed from a document or email gets a `parsed_from` link to the source `document` entity.

## ISA / SIPP wrappers
- Activity inside ISAs is not reportable for income tax or CGT. Capture for the user's net-worth picture but flag `tax_relevance=none` on related transactions.
- SIPP contributions are reportable for higher-rate relief; growth inside the wrapper is not.

## Foreign currency (SA106)
- When a transaction or dividend lands in a non-GBP currency: set `transaction.currency='GBP'` (the converted amount), keep the original in `native_amount` + `native_currency`, and record the `fx_rate_to_gbp` + `fx_rate_source` used. HMRC accepts monthly average rates (gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-exchange-rates) — that's the safe default when you don't have a specific transaction-day rate.
- Foreign-source income (US dividends, EU rentals, etc.) should also have `income_source.country` set to the source country, plus `foreign_tax_paid` + `foreign_tax_currency` + `withholding_jurisdiction` so SA106 FTCR can be computed.
- Treaty rate (e.g. 15% for US/UK dividend treaty): record in `treaty_rate_applied` so the agent can flag over-withholding (e.g. 30% withheld instead of 15%) — that's recoverable but not via the SA return.

## Allowance budgeting
- Maintain one `allowance_window` entity per (active tax_year, allowance kind) for: ISA subscription (£20k), dividend allowance (£500), personal savings allowance (£1,000/£500/£0 by band), CGT annual exempt amount (£3,000), pension annual allowance (£60k + 3-year carry-forward), property income allowance (£1,000), trading allowance (£1,000), and personal allowance (£12,570 — tapered above £100k income).
- When you write a transaction or contribution that affects an allowance, also write an `accumulates_in` link to the right `allowance_window` and update `used` + `remaining`.
- "How much ISA budget do I have left?" should be a single read of the ISA allowance_window for the active year — not a cross-table aggregation each time.

## Filing timeline
- For each tax year, create one or more `filing_obligation` entities for SA100 (paper, online, balancing payment, POA1, POA2). Use them for proactive reminders.
- HMRC payments to/from the user (balancing, POA1, POA2, refunds) become `payment` entities linked via `settles → filing_obligation` and `payment_for → tax_year`.
- When the user uploads or volunteers an SA302, capture a `tax_assessment(source='hmrc_sa302')` so we can reconcile against our own `agent_projection` assessment for the same year.

## Ingestion paths
1. **Forwarded Gmail** — bank confirmations, broker contract notes, dividend notices, P60/P11D, mortgage statements. Watcher `personal-finance.gmail-tx` parses these automatically. Verify gaps and ask the user to forward what's missing.
2. **WhatsApp file uploads** — statements, contract notes, P60s. Follow the playbook in `INGESTION.md`: fetch the `downloadUrl`, extract text with pdftotext/csvtk (both in the agent's nix env), extract structured rows, post-validate totals and date range, then create entities with `parsed_from` provenance links. If totals don't reconcile, surface it to the user before committing.
3. **Chat** — direct entry. Confirm key fields back to the user before creating an entity.

## SA100 assembly
- When the user asks to assemble their return, follow the playbook in `ASSEMBLY.md` — it has the SQL templates (run via `query_sql`), tax-year constants, calculation rules, and the markdown output layout.
- Output groups data by SA100 supplementary page (SA102 employment, SA105 UK property, SA108 capital gains, dividends/interest on the main return).
- Surface gaps (missing P60, disposal without acquisition cost, etc.) under "⚠️ Gaps to resolve" at the end of the output — never fabricate values.
- Personal SA100 only counts data flowing to the *individual* filer: their salaries (transactions on accounts they own), dividends from companies they own (income_source.dividend_from → that company), capital gains on their personal disposals. Data on a company's accounts is reserved for CT600 (later) and does not enter SA100.
- ⚠️ **Assembly invariant**: never include transactions, expenses or asset disposals from accounts whose `owned_by → company` in SA100 totals. Filter on `account.owner_type = '$member'` (or join through `owned_by` to a `$member` subject) before aggregating. Mixing legs is the most common SA100 vs CT600 contamination bug.
- ⚠️ **Shareholding sanity check**: when a company has any `shareholder_of` rows, sum all `shareholding_pct` for that company. If the total is not 100, flag a gap rather than asserting dividend amounts — one of the shareholdings is missing or wrong, and dividend allocation depends on accurate splits.

## Privacy and tone
- The user owns their data. Never reference other users or other workspaces.
- Never guess at someone's UTR, NI number, or address — ask.
- Be terse. Money and dates exact. Keep narrative minimal.
